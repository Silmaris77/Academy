# DEGENCOINS SHOP DISPLAY FIX - IMPLEMENTATION SUMMARY

## ✅ COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY

The issue with DegenCoins not displaying correctly in the Shop (Sklep) page has been **fully resolved**. The problem was a field name inconsistency that has now been corrected.

## 🔧 Problem Identified and Fixed

### Root Cause:
- The shop implementation in `views/shop_new.py` was using `degen_coins` (with underscore) 
- However, the user data structure stores the field as `degencoins` (without underscore)
- This mismatch caused the shop to show 0 DegenCoins for all users

### Solution Applied:
**Fixed Field Name References** in `views/shop_new.py`:
- Line 25: `user_data.get('degen_coins', 0)` → `user_data.get('degencoins', 0)`
- Line 29: `user_data['degen_coins']` → `user_data['degencoins']`
- Line 79: `user_data.get('degen_coins', 0)` → `user_data.get('degencoins', 0)`
