    """
```

- `"user_login"` - After user login (with streak tracking)
- `"xp_awarded"` - After XP is awarded (with amount data)
- `"degen_test_completed"` - After completing personality test

### Data Tracking Added
- **Lesson completion:** Daily lesson count, last lesson date
- **Quiz performance:** Score tracking, quiz participation
- **Login streaks:** Consecutive login days, last login date
- **XP progression:** Total XP, individual award amounts
- **Test completion:** Degen type, test completion status
